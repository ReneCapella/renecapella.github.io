       Press a button over a touch capacitor (around an LED) and watch it light it as though you're painting with a spray can! What could go wrong???

        A lot of things can go wrong. It was delightful. Calibration is vital. Queues help. If I had more time I'd make the 3 arduino set up work.

                    I wanted to make a digitized spray can. Originally the idea was to make a controller that would paint onto a screen using ultrasonic sensors. It was a brave start, but
                    using ultrasound sensors on the can alone would have been complicated in a different way than I had time for. Instead, I chose to spray digitally only a board of lights.

                    Whenever I start a new adventure, I like to sample my ideas on a small level. What's the riskiest assumption here? 
                    I think the riskiest assumption is that an LED will light if it's in the center of a 
                    tin-foil touch capacitor on a foam board covered in cloth.

                  And when that risk is tested...I like to scale. I cut 6 holes into a foam board for the RGB LEDs. I naively contemplated more.
                  Then I attached the foil and hooked up wires to two sections. Complete with fading!

                From here I foiled up the whole foam board. I hooked up all the wires with two arduinos, too.
                The foam board sat nicely in a wooden tray we had laying around. This tray made an EXCELLENT carrying device.
                It also has holes on both sides to carry... and put wires through...like 9V power source cords.

                    Calibration is essential for this project. I was able to make the sensors work as intented without
                    calibration, but when the sensor moves or someone sneezes, I'd have to manually adjust the code. 
                    "It worked yesterday!?" was a frequent thought throughout this project. Above I calibrate the three lights 
                    upon starting the program and run it again every 700 cycles.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                  Another very helpful tool was the ArduinoQueue library to facilitate the FIFO structure needed to fade the LEDs in their lit order.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                A significant problem I encountered early on involved the LEDs adding twice or three or 10 times to the queue causing the light to hop to 255 and fade many times in a row.
                To fix this, I set a state on each pin. Once the state has changed upon the first fade per cycle, the light doesn't repeat coming on (although its probably still in the queue). 
                This is also why the queue is initiated at 20. If it were only 3, lights would triple-add themselves to the queue, run and fade...but then any extra ligihts would stay lit.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                  Overall, I loved working on this project. I started small and thought I could scale the proect with no issues. I didn't realize the sensors would need calibration so frequently.
                  Had I known the sensor would change so drastically over short intervals (even with calibration!), I probably would have stopped scaling at 3 and started testing the casing and spray can.
                  Instead, I scalledto 6 LEDs and spent 5 days trying to make the 6 work reliably. In that time I also got to work with the Wire library and the 12C protocol. I actually connected three arduinos,
                  but the code had latency issues that wouldn't work for the application here. NEVERTHELESS, I learned so much and want to keep going.
