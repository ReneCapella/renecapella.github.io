                This group of circuits first detects whether an object is close. If an object *is* 
                close, then it determines whether to "R" run if it's dark or "H" hide (displayed) if it's light out.
			</p>
            <p id="paragraph1">
                Makes sense: if it's light, hiding is best. But if it's dark?? Your predator likely has
                evolve specialized olfactory skills. You need to run stat.

                I... just wanted to use the ultrasonic wave sensor. I was a little discouraged
                when I realized it was digital and not analog... but I made it work!

                This was fun. It's a little critter! I also enjoyed the wire management.

                    This image is of the circuit using the ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic
                    sensor sends out a pulse through "trig" pin. The signal hits an object and bounces
                    back. The "echo" pin detects the pulse's return. I then use calculations from <a href="https://youtu.be/ZejQOX69K5M" style="margin:0;">this site</a> to understand the logic behind the code used.

                    This image is of the circuit using the seven segment LED display & Photoresistor. I was going to
                    use the 4, 7 segment LED displays, but WOW they use so many wires and pins! I worked really hard 
                    on trying to keep the wires together and of similar color (white) save for that 
                    one outlier orange one -_- Pin 3 and 8 are to GND.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                    The photoresistor has variable resistance based on the amount of light in the room.
                    by meansure the resistance (using that helpful formula!) using a voltage divider, which means
                    I have an input reading between the two resistors.
