                Summary
            </h2>
			<p id="paragraph1">
                This project includes 2 libraries: LiquidCrystal and CapactiveSensor.
                The LCD screen prints the time taken for the sensor to recieve signal sent.
                So when nothing is touching the touch-capacitor, the value is 0 and when a giant bag of water
                like myself touches it, the value is in the thousands.
			</p>

            <h2>
                Struggles
            </h2>
			<p class="paragraph2">
                The LCD screen was complicated- lots of weird characters were displaying. Initially,
                I also was getting backwards readings from the touch-capacitor. 
			</p>

            <h2>
                Wins
            </h2>
			<p class="paragraph3">
                It working was a win. I also felt a sense of accomplishment when I solved the backwards values
                on the touch-capacitor.

                    On the far left you can see the the touch-capacitor with 1M resistor. I chose 1M because I 
                    wanted to activate the sensor with "complete touch" as referenced <a href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/" style="margin:0;">here</a>
                    .In the middle
                    is the poteniometer that adjusts the contrast of the LCD. On the far right is the LCD 
                    where I display the touch capacitor values.
