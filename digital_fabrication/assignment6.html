      <p id="paragraph1">
          Busy busy: two projects underway: molds and lamps! For the lamp, I started iterating on the acrylic pieces and lamp base. For the molds, I have two iterations for the molds!

          Struggles

			<p class="paragraph2">
        Cutting acrylic is difficult! I finally found the perfect spped and power setting after a whole day of failures. Even then, it required minor adjustments for each color. The lamp base was also multiple iterations, but this was expected. I also tried to use silk PLA for printing the molds, but needed to abandon it because of adhesion issues mid-print.

        I finally figured out the cutting acrylic settings!! The lamp base prints nicely and fits snuggly with the acrylics, AND the molding and casting project is well on its way!

          <h3>From the Assignment</h3>
          <p>Design and fabricate a 2-part (silicone) mold.   You will need to use the mold to cast at least 4 identical parts (e.g. in plaster).

          Design your master part in CAD first, then design your mold, then design a mold to cast your mold in. So meta!

          You need to 3d print your molds-for-molds. Then you need to cast your molds! Then you need to cast your parts!
         </p>

            You should start fabrication and iteration as early as possible for a project. This project took 3 days to tune all the settings and equiptment for the project. I didn't anticipate the difficultly cutting acrylic with a 10W CR-Falcon diode laser cutter, and I didn't anticipate the complications of a 20cm print OR the LEDs it would hold.
          </p>

            Acrylics look great! They are not great to laser cut!

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Every color has different settings. I've noticed blue shades tend to require more force than warmer tones.

              The lamp base took many iterations. I wanted something precise...
            </p>
            <!-- <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/-.png" alt="" > -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              but with height...
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              that didn't take 1+ days to print and could easily show light.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              Ultimately, the lamp is fun and modular. I wish I had more time to practice with the acrylics for this project.

                <h3>Molds</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I started early on the molds after light scolding from Prof Nadya last week. I initally tried to find my own thingiverse stl to toy with.
            </p>
            <!-- <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/-.png" alt="" > -->
            <!-- <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/-.png" alt="" > -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              But it wasn't working. I took this interesting flat low poly crow, inversed it and paired it with the other piece to make the half bird whole... but the draft analysis was difficult. I wasn't sure how to proceed with complex geometries.
            </p>
            <!-- <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/-.png" alt=""> -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              As basic as it sounds, I chose to model something on my level: I made a star with rounded edges. It was more complicated than this, because it took my a whole hour filleting the edges to a perfect position.
            </p>
            <!-- <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/-.png" alt="" > -->
            <!-- <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/-.png" alt="" > -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              The work paid, off though. I was able to take the star and replicate the the mold process with ribbon offset we saw in class. The star wasn't complicated, but the process still took time. Adding mating surface elements and pipes were also more intricate to design than I thought.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              First print fully failed with silk PLA. Fortunately it was smaller, but I learned my "more than 45 degree" angled runners needed more care with settings to actually print well. In the second iteration, I've removed these.
