        My first attempt was a tv on the head of an adult holding up and kissing a young child. When MeshBooleanUnion-ing, it crashed Rhino several times. I left it for my vicious snail. My first vicious snail couldn't pass, so I made a second cat snail that did.

        I ended up making lots of snails - 3! Also, I appreciate learning how to assess and fix a mesh-- the fixing was interesting to think about and Google solutions. I might make this snail as holiday gifts.

          <h3>From the Assignment</h3>
          <p>1. Modify the mesh of two STLs to produce a single printable STL. You may use whatever STLs you want, e.g. downloaded from Thingiverse or elsewhere! When exporting the STL from Rhino, it should pass all checks for rapid prototyping. </p>

          <p>2. Please make (a start on) a lamp! Using your lamp innereds' measurements as a point of departure, make a lamp that can be assembled around the innereds. You must make the lamp using digital fabrication techniques from prior weeks. You should be able to remove the lamp from the innereds again, so you cannot attach the lamp to the innereds with glue, fasteners, adhesive, etc. This will require you to think carefully about the interface between your parts. Imagine your lamp being in a domestic setting---perhaps it will not be wildly shaken, but it should not fall apart with normal use. For the rest of the lamp, get creative!</p>

          <h3>Merging Meshes!</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Meshes are easy to mess up. By merging two meshes together, you're able to manifest these issues. For instance: intersecting faces, holes, crashing software, and more!
          </p>
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Finding meshes should have been an easy task, but without know what I wanted to blend, I struggled finding objects without perusing <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a>.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Originally, I found models <a href="https://flyingarchitecture.com/3d-models">at Flyingarchitecture.com</a>. These were great for rendering, but exporting to STL was much harded because meshes were not closed. My MeshBooleanUnion hung at 83% for a long while before crashing Rhino.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            It wasn't all bad, though, because it provided space for more practice with rotation and placement of model parts.
          </p>
          <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/TVparent.png" alt="">
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            After crashing twice, I found the snail and the bearded viking. No regrets; he's adorable.
          </p>
          <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/grumbleSnailMesh.jpeg" alt="">
          <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/sayAhhh.png" alt="">

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Alas, BeardSnail had too many intersecting faces. 71 at one point. Reducing the mesh got this down to 40, but I couldn't do much better.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            I printed him anyway.
          </p>
          <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/betterbeardursula.jpeg" alt="">
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Then, I found the angry cat, who, after lots of tinkering, not only looked great printed, but also was rated a "good mesh":)

            <h3>Lamp</h3>
              I am creating a lamp for my family's book nook. We are a family of 5 in 1000sqft, so every space matters. This space is where many of go to read, tinker, and play games.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/booknook.jpeg" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              We are also a floor-seated household (we like furniture low to the ground). Finding lamps to accommodate this is difficult. We current have a lamp that blinds us from below. We also have lights that shine from above, but it creates unwanted shadows.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/floorsitbooknook.jpeg" alt="" >
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/nightbooknook.jpeg" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              We also have a fireplace here. During the winter we might use this once or twice -- but it's a barren black hole otherwise.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/lampbooknook.jpeg" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              So I'm going to see if I can brighten this gloom hole up.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              After brainstorming shapes and getting all the basic ideas out of my head, I noticed a pattern of layers and translucency.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/firstsketch.jpeg" alt="" >
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/secondfirstsketch.png" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              So, I ran with this for a small while.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/secondsketch.jpeg" alt="" >
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/secondsecondsketch.jpeg" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              The layered shapes caught, and I thought of sandwiching them between clear acrylic -- and considered how to place this in the fireplace so that colorful shapes were seen from front and shaped-casted color (there's a difference!) was casted behind in the cavern.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/panesketch.jpeg" alt="" >
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/chimneysketch.jpeg" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I like this the most. I think it's delicate and complex. I think it's graceful and not too full of itself. It's friendly.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A6/danglesketch.jpeg" alt="">
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              How else could I layer these color panes? Hanging them? Getting the materials felt pressing, so I ordered these while I sketched,and installed better exhaust for the laser printer (not pictured).
