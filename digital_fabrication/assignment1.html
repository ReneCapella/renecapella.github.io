          Summary
      </h2>
      <p id="paragraph1">
				This project explores how to operate a laser cutter and how to generate models for the machine to use. It is a kit of 30 cardboard instances of one part that can be press-fit together and survive a gentle shaking.
			</p>

      <h2>
          Struggles
      </h2>

			<p class="paragraph2">
				Assembling the laser cutter, a Falcon CR-Laser, updating firmware, and learning how to interface with it using non-MacCompatible software.
			</p>

      <h2>
          Wins
      </h2>

			<p class="paragraph2">
				Once I figured out the workflow, it was challenging and satisfying to learn how to creating gcode files in Lightburn, transfer these to a tf/microSD, and watch models materialize.

      </h2>

      <p id="paragraph1">
        Make a kit consisting of at least 30 instances of at least one unique part! The parts must have slots that press fit into the other parts in the kit! The parts must be laser cut out of cardboard! Your fit should be such that the parts do not come apart with a light shaking!
