          Casting is very satisfying.

        I felt concern about bubbles and runners. It took a few pours to get the feel for consistency of the hydrostone and how to pour it into the tiny mold.

        I want to do more molding and casting.

			<h3>Assignment 6.5</h3>

      <div class="assignmentOuterImages">
          <h3>From the Assignment</h3>
          <p>Design and fabricate a 2-part (silicone) mold.   You will need to use the mold to cast at least 4 identical parts (e.g. in plaster).

          Design your master part in CAD first, then design your mold, then design a mold to cast your mold in. So meta!

          You need to 3d print your molds-for-molds. Then you need to cast your molds! Then you need to cast your parts!
         </p>

              This is where we left off last week:
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A65/mold/orangeStars.png" alt="" >

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              This all unfolded over Saturday afternoon.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I was anticipating the silicone mixtures A/B to be cured in the bottle again... so I had two backups. I know have a lot of silicone, because the first one worked!
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A65/mixed.png" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              Lots of anxiety about where to pour this in the mold to avoid bubbles.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A65/pour1.png" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              Getting this out was a problem: I designed the mold casing with a bottom. Removing the silicone required I used a firm, flat edge to pry it out - potentially damaging the casing or cast.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A65/cozycopper.png" alt="" >
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A65/copperstretch.png" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              It worked out okay, though.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A65/peelout.png" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              The hydrostone mixed well - I found it to be very forgiving. The amount we were given for the project was perfect.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A65/hydrostonepour.png" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              Because I didn't use runners, when I poured in the mixture, I needed the two mold halves to "breathe" a bit. I needed a little to drain through the cracks so I could fill it completely (I know, the point of runners).
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I felt more secure using the vice to hold it in place.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A65/vice.png" alt="" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              So adorable. Peeling these out each time was a complete joy.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              Later in the evening, I went through and filed several of them. I left a few with the 3D print traces and one with the spout still attached. Having the different versions tells a small story.
