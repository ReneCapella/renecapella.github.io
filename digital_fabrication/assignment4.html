      <p id="paragraph1">
        This was a quest for the perfect cube. iteration after iteration in pursuit of best quality + dimensions to allow for ease of construction but snug fit.

          Struggles
      </h2>

        Super quality prints really struggled with this. I needed to raise the bed temperature to maintain adhesion which cost a lot of time in starting/stopping

          Wins

			<p class="paragraph2">
        This felt like data collection for me. I solved holding sugar on the third iteration, but keep trying (yep, still going) different settings. I have something like 8-12 cubes in labelled bags with dimensions, notes, printer bed and nozzel temps, and quaity.

          <h3>From the Assignment</h3>
          <p>Design a box that is made up of flat panels with fingerjoints/boxjoints, tabs, or another joining method design for sheet material. Your panels and all tabs need to be 3d printed, but you cannot 3D print the box in one piece. Design for an interference fit, that is, when you press the panels together they should join tightly and not need additional fasteners and screws. Furthermore, they should provide a close enough fit that your resulting box can hold something like sugar without leaking. </p>

          <h3>Opening Notes</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            I think the process of documentation and observation was very impactful for me in this assignment, so I'm going to set you up with the foundations and guidance to do this yourself.
          </p>

          <h3>Setting up</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            For this project you'll need some software:
            <ul>
              <li>Rhino 8 or equivalent to open the source files</li>
              <li>Cura or similar to create gcode</li>
              <li>An FDM 3D printer</li>
              <li>Filament</li>
              <li>Optional: Bags</li>
              <li>Optional: Sharpie</li>
              <li>Optional: Calipers</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Use the source files above labelled "starting template." Open it in Rhino or equivalent software. This is a 2cm x 2cm set of 4 curves that I started with. There are no offsets or extrusions. Copy these curves, paste them nearby, and only extrude this copy. No modifactions this round - see what the starting point gets you.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Preseve those curves for future iterations. When your ready to print, use text in your file to note the dimensions and relevant notes beside your iteration.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Export these pieces to STL. Open the STL in Cura. Quality is up to you; makes process shorter to use low. Slice it!
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Print it. I'll wait here.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            FOR ME, this wouldn't fit together, which makes sense: there is no space in the pieces to allow for a join to occur. The sides just butt up against eachother. We need to know the tolerances of our design.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            So write down what happened. Save the loose pieces in a bag (I used a clear zip up bag). Write down on the bag or on a note in the bag the dimensions and quality of print.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Now get to work. Make a new copy of the curves and start to tinker. What can you adjust to give space (more tolerance)? Once you're set, write down your dimensions, select your new pieces and "export selected" to STL, open in cura, slice it, and print!
          </p>

            <h3>My results</h3>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A4/rhino.png" alt=""
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I used 'offset' in this assignment on two out of the four cubes of varying size to reduce the size and give space for fitting together. For the bottom, I used an shrinking offset that would compensate for the largest of the four sides but also create some hold with the smaller sides.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              After 8 iterations, I went back to cube 3's offset amounts. It clicks so well! A 2.8mm thickness, 2 sides with a shrinking .15 offset and a bottom with .1 shrinking offset.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I bumped up the quality to see results, and I think Low-Standard results are better! I has more structure. I wonder if I could achieve this with other settings like infill?
              </p>
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I thought at this point that the bottom gaps could be closer, so I proceeded dialing this in with minor adjustments to offsets by using my calipers.
            </p>
