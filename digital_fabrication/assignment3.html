          Summary
      </h2>
      <p id="paragraph1">
				Through a series of printing standard cubes and shapes, I learn the subtle difference settings afford in 3D printing. Using Rhino, I model a clip to hold two pieces of cardboard together, and print 25 of these (11 hours!).

      <h2>
          Struggles
      </h2>

			<p class="paragraph2">
				Bed Tramming. I initially thought I needed to "bed level" after each print (which wasn't actually working) and that a rocking bed was appropriate. Titghted those bolts: solved.
			</p>

      <h2>
          Wins
      </h2>

			<p class="paragraph2">
				Figurein the bed tramming issue out was lovely. All prints after this were really delightful to think about, explore settings, and watch form.

			<h3>Assignment 3</h3>

      <p id="paragraph1">
        Do this:
        <ol>
          <li>build the printer (document!)</li>
          <li>Print 3 cubes: low, standard, and super quality</li>
          <li>Print 1 cube with a concentric top</li>
          <li>Print 2 tubes with varying z-alignment and wall thickness</li>
          <li>Print 2 cylindars, one with spiralized contour, and another on its side with supports</li>
          <li>Model a Clip that will hold two pices of cardboard together and can survive a good shake</li>
          <li>Print 15+ of them</li>
        </ol>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              Building the printer was very straightforward. We spent about an hour getting the parts out, verifying and learning about items, and then assembly.
          </p>

            <!-- <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A3/-.png" alt="" -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                Cubes are an excellent object to print. Looking at mine, I can tell which settings employed. I also see a huge jump in quality when I finally figure out my bed rocking situation.

            <!-- <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A3/-.png" alt="" -->
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                I didn't realize someof the shapes were tubes. I assummed they were all cylinders. So, I made several cylinders with 1 and 2 wall thickness:) The 1 wall thickness let to see a subtle shadown of the infill, which I thought was beautiful.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                Once I got through that confusion, though, the delicate tubes I made seemed very delicate. The random z-alignment setting created a web of strings within the tube versus the regular z-alignment.

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                My youngest wanted to be involved in this portion -- I don't blame him. I drew out clips we saw in class and showed him how to draw this shape as acurve in Rhino and then extride it.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                Our first iteration would clip two pieces together, but the wiggle didn't look promising. We increased the height of the clip and made the bridge between sides more narrow.

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              3D printing is a whole world. Researching settings, filament, stl files on line, upgrades, tricks and tips, and troubleshooting showed me how large the online community is around this star trek-y machine.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              My whole family is in love with out printer. We have a queue of prints from each of us (2 adults, 3 kids). The machines hum is thrumming when I fall asleep. The crackling of cooling PLA woke me once. Waking up to printed things is like Christmas.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              This assignment, like all the others, helped me develop a sense for how to engage with the machine. All the steps broadened my awareness of 3D printing capabilities.
