          Summary

      <p id="paragraph1">
				Through a series of printing standard cubes and shapes, I learn the subtle difference settings afford in 3D printing. Using Rhino, I model a clip to hold two pieces of cardboard together, and print 25 of these (11 hours!).

				Bed Tramming. I initially thought I needed to "bed level" after each print (which wasn't actually working) and that a rocking bed was appropriate. Titghted those bolts: solved.

          <h3>Printer Build: Ender 3 S1 Pro</h3>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              Building the printer was very straightforward. We spent about an hour getting the parts out, verifying and learning about items, and then assembly.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            The light flickered while printing, so investigating the power supply and consulting Bard, I learned there's a switch to 115V in the back of the printer. The flickering was fixed.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            The protocol for tramming is to find the auxillary leveling feature in settings, and, as the extruder bulk moves around the bed, place a pieces of paper under and wiggle wiggle wiggle. Adjusting the knobs then raises or lowers the bed in that area so that the paper can still wiggle, but there's a tension present.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            After setting everything up, however, my first several test runs weren't runing well.
          </p>

          <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A3/7FirstGaff.png" alt="">

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            I noticed the bed was rocking side to side earlier on, but I thought it was normal. Tightening the knobs didn't seem to do anything, so I assummed. You should never assume.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            According to Ricky Impey, a YouTuber, your bed shouldn't rock, and you should only have to level your bed once in a rare while. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eQ_rBzfm5s">Watch here.</a>
          </p>
          <p>So I went hunting under my machine and tightened some things</p>

                Cubes are an excellent object to print. Looking at mine, I can tell which settings employed. I also see a huge jump in quality when I finally figure out my bed rocking situation.

                I didn't realize someof the shapes were tubes. I assummed they were all cylinders. So, I made several cylinders with 1 and 2 wall thickness:) The 1 wall thickness let to see a subtle shadown of the infill, which I thought was beautiful.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                Once I got through that confusion, though, the delicate tubes I made seemed very delicate. The random z-alignment setting created a web of strings within the tube versus the regular z-alignment.

                Our first iteration would clip two pieces together, but the wiggle didn't look promising. We increased the height of the clip and made the bridge between sides more narrow.

              My whole family is in love with out printer. We have a queue of prints from each of us (2 adults, 3 kids). The machines hum is thrumming when I fall asleep. The crackling of cooling PLA woke me once. Waking up to printed things is like Christmas.
