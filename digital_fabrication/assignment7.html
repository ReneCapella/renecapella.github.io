        I felt concern about bubbles and runners. It took a few pours to get the feel for consistency of the hydrostone and how to pour it into the tiny mold.

      <div class="assignmentOuterImages">
          <h3>From the Assignment</h3>
          <p>Design and fabricate a 2-part (silicone) mold.   You will need to use the mold to cast at least 4 identical parts (e.g. in plaster).

          Design your master part in CAD first, then design your mold, then design a mold to cast your mold in. So meta!

          You need to 3d print your molds-for-molds. Then you need to cast your molds! Then you need to cast your parts!
         </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Like Professor Nadya explains: You should start fabrication and iteration as early as possible for a project.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            ANYTHING could happen. Your 10W diode laser that you're just learning to use could not be strong enough to cut the colors of acrylic you want. Said laser could also take several days and many sheets of acrylic to calibrate.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Acrylics look great! They are not easy to laser cut, though, with a 10W diode laser! I've noticed blue shades tend to require more force than warmer tones. 27 passes at 90% power 3mm/s speed...is...a lot.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            All that said, let's take off where we left off last week. Nook needs a new look...er...lamp. I like this idea of overlapping transparencies and abstract shapes.
          </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              The lamp base took many iterations. I wanted something precise that didn't take 1+ days to print and could easily show light.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A7/lamp/hugelampbase.png" alt="" >

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              Once I found a decent size with al the right tolerances, the print went smoothly.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A7/lamp/lastBasePrint.png" alt="" >

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              Ultimately, the lamp is fun and modular. I've added a cover to the LEDs, and I've realized the need for more colored cover to allow more interesting color shadows to hit the fireplace walls.

            With the cover and end caps, the base could be a lamp in itself.

                <h3>Molds</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I started early on the molds after light scolding from Prof Nadya last week. I initally tried to find my own thingiverse stl to toy with.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I found an interesting flat low poly crow, inversed it and paired it with the other piece to make the half bird whole... but the draft analysis was difficult. I wasn't sure how to proceed with complex geometries.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A7/mold/birdDraftAnalysis.png" alt="">
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              So, I wanted to keep it simple. I chose to model something on my level: I made a star with rounded edges. It was more complicated than this, because it took my a whole hour filleting the edges to a perfect position.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A7/mold/star1.png" alt="" >
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A7/mold/star2.png" alt="" >
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A7/mold/star3.png" alt="" >

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              The work paid, off though. I was able to take the star and replicate the the mold process with ribbon offset we saw in class. The star wasn't complicated, but the process still took time. Adding mating surface elements and pipes were also more intricate to design than I thought.
            </p>

            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A7/mold/star6OffsetBlend.png" alt="" >

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              First print fully failed with silk PLA. Fortunately it was smaller, but I learned my "more than 45 degree" angled runners needed more care with settings to actually print well. In the second iteration, I've removed these.
