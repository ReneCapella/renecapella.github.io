        This project explores how to operate a laser cutter and how to generate models for the machine to use. It is a kit of 30 cardboard instances of one part that can be press-fit together and survive a gentle shaking.

			<h3>Assignment 2</h3>
      <h2 id="assignmentHeading1">
        From the assignment:
      </h2>
      <p id="paragraph1">
        Create a parametric model using a grasshopper definition. Using your model, design parts to be laser cut that can be clipped together. At least one of your parts should enable you to connect one of your pieces to another without use of glue or fasteners. Your grasshopper definition should allow you to vary the thickness of your materials, and also vary other design parameters. Include notes in your grasshopper definition so it's clear what a user should input and bake.

        Laser cut your parts and construct your physical model. Your physical model should contain at least 30 parts.

        Submit the grasshopper definition, your cut files, and a documentation of your laser cut object.

      </p>

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I wanted to make a dragon, so I found a diy scale on pinterest <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/312015080448329151/"></a>. It wasn't going to be enough for a whole sheet because it was only the spine, but I modelled it and gleaned some insights.

          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              The next iteration created an interest diagonal scale progression that would allow rows. However, when I assembled it, I realized the hole above the scale needed to be shifted to the left to allow for offset rows like a stereotypical "scale" on a fix or dragon appears.

            <h3>Rhino and Grasshopper</h3>

            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A2/VariablePipeWithSegmentsAndBoxes.png" alt="This image is shows a red snake-looking surface in Rhino with a cage." >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                This started slowly. I wanted to reproduce the project we started in class. I couldn't get it to work in class, so I thought it would be a good challenge to complete.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                I spent a considerable amount of time learning how to make a variable pipe. This wasn't necessarily because a variable pipe is difficult. There were new mental models and words I needed to ramp up with. This task helped me explore Grasshopper.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A2/AngryPeeps.png" alt="Image of marshmallow peep-like structure in Rhino." >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                After adjusting the radius of different parameters of the pipe, I settled on this chunkier, marshmallow-peep shape. After completing the box morph, it looks heavily armored. I love it.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                I quickly realized, however, that the jutting edges would also need to morph onto the adjacent segments of the peep surface, and given the approaching deadline, I simplified to a cylinder.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                At this point, I didn't realize I needed to parametrically create my curve of my replicating piece. I immediately started down what ended up being an 8 hour excusion to figure out how to make this happen.

                The setting I determed earlier cut through perfectly.

                ...and by fortune, the 2mm option fit snuggly. Time to start making!!

            <h3>Finally Starting the Assignment</h3>

            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A1/4NextStepsCirclesLB.png" alt="LightBurn interface in the foreground with the laser cutter in the background. The lightburn screen shows an image of lots of circles" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                In my household, my children by me lots of legos. Recently, because I decided fake flowers that looked real was ridiculous, I started building fake flowers with the lego kits and putting them all over my house.

                This inspired me to try and build a press kit for a flower. Starting simply, I started with circles to build a basic flower.
            </p>

            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A1/5NextStepsCirclesCutting.png" alt="Laser cutter cutting circles into cardboard" >

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                Ran smoothly.

                I popped some of the pieces out for trial, and felt really good about my exploratory pressing together-ing.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A1/9Committed.png" alt="Laser cutter cutting circles into cardboard" >
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A1/11FirstFlowerForm.png" alt="Cardboard Flower made of circular cardboard pieces fit together" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                I was commited. I carefully put together my first flower form.

                I decided I wanted more of the medium circles perpendicular to the first flower form.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A1/12LetsMakeMoreStemPot.png" alt="Lightburn interface with flower-looking images" >

            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A1/14MoreCompleted.png" alt="Laser cutter print out out a flower and flower pot images on cardboard" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                I created a circular piece with a stem and a pot with flower piece to press fit into the stem.

                I also cut out more circles to make 30 medium and 30 small circular bits.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A1/15DogSaysThisIsNotRight.png" alt="cardboard flower dying because its stem is loosening away from the base" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                My dog immediately notices this flower is a failure.

                I assumed the 2mm gap width would hold at any length. I was wrong, the longer the gap, the more the ends would flare.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A1/16MaybeJustStem.png" alt="scope management" >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                In a project, we have three constraints: resounces, time, and scope.

                I had boundless resources. Machine + computer + software +cardboard for days.

                I had limited very limited time. My laser cutter didn't arrive until Tuesday, and I needed to finish before class on Wednesday at 12p so I could attend another class before the deadline.

                So scope had to be prunned. I chose to keep it at the stem. This would free up my nest day for documentation:)

          <h3>Fin!</h3>
          <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A1/17Summary.png" alt="image of cardboard flower and the cardboard from which the pieces were popped out of" >
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
              I learned so much. Operating and understanding how to interface with these machines is my goal for this class, and I feel ramped up because of the challenges faced.

              For next time: I bought a hood/casing with a fan. I had lots of ventilation and a mask, but it wasn't enough. Need more PPE. I also want more goggles for my family.

              Figuring out how to start with Illustrator and transfer to lightburn would be a good workflow improvement. Because I have to work offline with this machine, I'm wondering if I can find a free software that converts SVGs to gcode/gc files the cutter will recognize.
