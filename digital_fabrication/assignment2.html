        This project explores how to operate a laser cutter and how to generate models for the machine to use. It is a kit of 30 cardboard instances of one part that can be press-fit together and survive a gentle shaking.

			<h3>Assignment 2</h3>
      <h2 id="assignmentHeading1">
        From the assignment:
      </h2>
      <p id="paragraph1">
        Create a parametric model using a grasshopper definition. Using your model, design parts to be laser cut that can be clipped together. At least one of your parts should enable you to connect one of your pieces to another without use of glue or fasteners. Your grasshopper definition should allow you to vary the thickness of your materials, and also vary other design parameters. Include notes in your grasshopper definition so it's clear what a user should input and bake.

        Laser cut your parts and construct your physical model. Your physical model should contain at least 30 parts.

        Submit the grasshopper definition, your cut files, and a documentation of your laser cut object.

      </p>

              I wanted to make a dragon, so I found a diy scale on pinterest <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/312015080448329151/"></a>. It wasn't going to be enough for a whole sheet because it was only the spine, but I modelled it and gleaned some insights.

              The next iteration created an interest diagonal scale progression that would allow rows. However, when I assembled it, I realized the hole above the scale needed to be shifted to the left to allow for offset rows like a stereotypical "scale" on a fix or dragon appears.

            <h3>Rhino and Grasshopper</h3>

            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A2/VariablePipeWithSegmentsAndBoxes.png" alt="This image is shows a red snake-looking surface in Rhino with a cage." >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                This started slowly. I wanted to reproduce the project we started in class. I couldn't get it to work in class, so I thought it would be a good challenge to complete.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                I spent a considerable amount of time learning how to make a variable pipe. This wasn't necessarily because a variable pipe is difficult. There were new mental models and words I needed to ramp up with. This task helped me explore Grasshopper.
            </p>
            <img id="assignmentInnerImages" src="assets/A2/AngryPeeps.png" alt="Image of marshmallow peep-like structure in Rhino." >
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                After adjusting the radius of different parameters of the pipe, I settled on this chunkier, marshmallow-peep shape. After completing the box morph, it looks heavily armored. I love it.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                I quickly realized, however, that the jutting edges would also need to morph onto the adjacent segments of the peep surface, and given the approaching deadline, I simplified to a cylinder.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                At this point, I didn't realize I needed to parametrically create my curve of my replicating piece. I immediately started down what ended up being an 8 hour excusion to figure out how to make this happen.

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                I finally made it happen, though:)

                Lightburn was much easier this time around.

              I learned so much. Operating and understanding how to interface with these machines is my goal for this class, and I feel ramped up because of the challenges faced.

              For next time: I bought a hood/casing with a fan. I had lots of ventilation and a mask, but it wasn't enough. Need more PPE. I also want more goggles for my family.

              Figuring out how to start with Illustrator and transfer to lightburn would be a good workflow improvement. Because I have to work offline with this machine, I'm wondering if I can find a free software that converts SVGs to gcode/gc files the cutter will recognize.
