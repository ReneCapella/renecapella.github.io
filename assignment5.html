                Summary
            </h2>
			<p id="paragraph1">
                This project included a logic load and an external power load of 12V. I used ultrasonic sensor and LED strip.

            <h2>
                Struggles
            </h2>
			<p class="paragraph2">
                Getting a smooth fade was difficult, and I'm also new to calculations for the LED strip.
                I also did this assignment twice.

                    This image above is a drawing (schematic) of the transistor being controlled by logicfrom the 
                    A1 input. The two pieces have a common ground. I also have information here
                    about the LED current and transistor. The LED count on the box wasn't easy to determine
                    so I used both the amperage on the box and the length of the strip. The math is all there. I got two
                    different numbers, so I put both. Either way, the current is less than the max of the transistor.

                    It's difficult to get the whole circuit in this one, because
                    if the pieces touch, I might fry a component. I learned this the hard way.
                    You can see the Arduino is here offering logic (if sensing an object near sensor -- A1, light LED strip).
